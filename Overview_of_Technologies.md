# Overview of Technologies

## Architecture Overview
The Space Simulation Python project is a 3D solar system simulation built using the Ursina game engine. The architecture follows a modular design pattern with clear separation of concerns between different systems.

## Key Components

### 1. Core Simulation
- **main.py**: Entry point that initializes the Ursina application and manages the main game loop
- **game_manager.py**: Central controller that manages all simulation components and updates
- **celestial_bodies.py**: Contains classes for stars, planets, and other celestial bodies

### 2. Orbital Mechanics
- **orbits.py**: Handles orbital position calculations and velocity
- **orbits_threaded.py**: Threaded version of orbital calculations for performance
- **thread_manager.py**: Manages background threads for async operations

### 3. Visual Systems
- **camera.py**: Comprehensive camera system with multiple perspectives and controls
- **light_manager.py**: Advanced lighting system with dynamic effects and performance optimization
- **assets_loader.py**: Threaded asset loading system for textures and models

### 4. User Interface
- **ui_manager.py**: Manages on-screen displays and performance statistics
- **selector.py**: Handles entity selection and interaction

### 5. Utilities
- **constants.py**: Centralized configuration for all simulation parameters
- **utilities.py**: Helper functions for math, color, and conversions

## Technology Stack
- **Ursina Engine**: Core 3D rendering and game engine
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Threading**: Used for background operations and performance optimization
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Accurate orbital mechanics and physics calculations

## Interconnections
1. **Initialization**: main.py sets up the Ursina application and creates GameManager
2. **Simulation Loop**: GameManager coordinates updates across all systems
3. **Rendering**: CameraManager and LightManager handle visual presentation
4. **User Interaction**: Selector and UIManager manage user input and feedback
5. **Background Processing**: ThreadManager handles async operations like asset loading and orbital calculations
