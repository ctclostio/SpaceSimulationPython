Looking at the code structure, here are some potential issues and the files that would need to be modified to fix them:

 1 Thread Safety Issues:

 • assets_loader.py - The ThreadedAssetsManager could have race conditions
 • orbits_threaded.py - The OrbitalCalculator needs proper thread synchronization

 2 Resource Management:

 • game_manager.py - Missing proper cleanup of resources
 • thread_manager.py - No thread cleanup on application exit

 3 Error Handling:

 • main.py - Incomplete error handling in GameLoop
 • camera.py - CameraLogger could have better error handling

 4 Performance Optimization:

 • celestial_bodies.py - Planet class could optimize position updates
 • frustum_culling.py - Could optimize visibility checks
