app = Ursina()'''
    Loads an image sequence as a frame animation.
    Consider using SpriteSheetAnimation instead if possible.
    So if you have some frames named image_000.png, image_001.png, image_002.png and so on,
    you can load it like this:Animation('image')

    You can also load a .gif by including the file type:Animation('image.gif')'''a =Animation('ursina_wink')

    app.run()
