## Powered by Python




Python is the world's most popular programming language for a reason. The ease of use of Python combined with ursina's design, makes it easy to write concise code and avoid lots of boilerplate code.






```python
ursinaimport*

app = Ursina()

cube  = Entity(model = 'cube', color = hsv(300, 1,1), scale = 2, collider = 'box')def spin():
    cube.animate('rotation_y', cube.rotation_y+360, duration = 2, curve = curve.in _out_expo)

cube.on_click = spin
EditorCamera()# add camera controlsfororbiting and moving the cameraapp.run()
```

## Make Any Type of Game

2D games, 3D games, applications, visualizations, you can make anything you want with ursina.

## Iterate Faster

• Reload code/textures/models while in-game
• Automatic import of .psd and .blend files
• Compile times:
Iteration speed benchmark. Time from code/scene change to play. Game: pong clone. Lower is better.

```python
engine:         duration:       times as slow:

ursina00.01s1x
Godot01.18s118x
Unity11.45s1145x
```

## Modern UI

• Sleek modern design.
• Full control. Change the looks of anything, down to the smallest details.
• Built with Entities like everything else, so you don't have to relearn anything.

• Built-in animation and tweening
• Pre-made prefabs such as FirstPersonController, 2d platformer controller, editor camera
• Lots of included procedural 3D primitives
• Many shaders to choose from, or write your own with GLSL
