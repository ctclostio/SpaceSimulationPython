Introduction Tutorial


## Creating and running a game

1) Open your preferred text editor. If you're new to programming, here are some suggestions:
* Atom
* Visual Studio Code
* Sublime Text
2) Create a new folder for your project. This will contain scripts and assets.
For ursina to find 3d models and textures, they should be in the same folder or in
a folder below the starting script.
In this folder, create a new file called main.py. This will contain our little game.
3) At the top of the file, write:

```python
ursinaimport*
```

This will import all the necessary things we need from the engine in one line.
It means something like 'from ursina import all'. It's also possible to import parts of the engine
like this:

```python
ursina.prefabsimportButton
```

Or import something that's not included by default:

```python
ursina.prefabs.first_person_controllerimportFirstPersonController
```

4) Here's a really basic example game with comments to explain what we're doing.
We will simply make an orange box move right and left when we press 'd' or 'a'.

```python
ursinaimport*# create a windowapp = Ursina()# most things in ursina are Entities. AnEntityis a thing you place in the world.# you can think of them as GameObjects in Unity or Actors in Unreal.# the first parameter tells us theEntity's model will be a3d-model called 'cube'.# ursina in cludes some basic models like'cube', 'sphere'and'quad'.# the next parameter tells us the model's color should be orange.#'scale_y = 2'tells us how big the entity should be in the vertical axis, how tall it should be.# in ursina, positive x is right, positive y is up, and positive z is for ward.player  = Entity(model = 'cube', color = color.orange, scale_y = 2)# create a function called'update'.# this will automatically get called by the engine every frame.def update():
    player.x  +=  held_keys['d'] * time.dt
    player.x  -=  held_keys['a'] * time.dt# this part will make the player move left or right based on our in put.# to check which keys are held down, we can check the held_keys dictionary.#0meansnotpressed and1means pressed.# time.dt is simply the time since the last frame. by multiplying with this, the# player will move at the same speed regardless of how fast the game runs.def in put(key):if key == 'space':
        player.y  +=  1invoke(setattr, player, 'y', player.y-1, delay = .25)# start running the gameapp.run()
```

5) Now we have to tell Python to run the script. To do this, open the command line and
go to the current folder. An easy way to do this is to type 'cmd' in the address bar.
Run the command below.

```python
python main.py
```

An alternative is to install the 'atom-python-run' package in Atom so you can start
the game by pressing F5.
